This repository contains the assignment given by Dr. Waqar Shahid to me, Ramish Masood. I created this assignment on Visual Studio 2017. The following program adds, subtracts, divides and multiplies complex numbers. Classes, linked lists and operator overloading is used to construct this program. It contains 5 files which are listed below.
**************************************************************************************************************************************
1. LinkedListFunctions.h & Operator.h which are opened under Header Files 
2. MainSourceFile.cpp, LinkedListFunctions.cpp & Operator.cpp which is opened under Source Files
**************************************************************************************************************************************
OUTPUT: Linked list is successfully created. 4+5i 3+-3i 4+3i

Complex number 1 & complex number 2 are added and inserted at end of linked list successfully. 4+5i 3+-3i 4+3i 7+2i

Complex number 3 is subtracted from complex number 1 & inserted at the end of linked list successfully. 4+5i 3+-3i 4+3i 7+2i 0+2i

Complex number 2 & complex number 3 is multiplied successfully. 4+5i 3+-3i 4+3i 7+2i 0+2i 21+-3i

Complex number 1 divided with complex number 3 successfully. 4+5i 3+-3i 4+3i 0+2i 21+-3i 1.24+0.32i
